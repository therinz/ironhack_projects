## Project Description
For this project, the objective was to load a very messy datasheet relating to shark attacks in Pandas and use various tools to clean the data. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
The objective is to use at least 8 methods to clean up the dataset as much as possible in the given time. Since there was no specific question / hypothesis, I choose to keep the file intact as much as possible, leaving many rows with partly incomplete values. This will facilitate any future reseach.

## Dataset
For this project we used the freely available dataset concerning shark attacks, which is available on Kaggle. We used version one compiled by The Global Shark Attack File. [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1)  

## Workflow
1. Determine steps to be taken
2. Set up csv in pandas and create copy to work with
3. Declare helper functions 
4. Gather information about shape and characteristics of dataframe
5. Check data types
6. Inspect data
7. Check null values
8. Change column names
9. Remove duplicates
10. Remove irrelevant columns
11. Convert dates
12. Clean data for various columns
12. Correct data types
14. Set new index according to unique tracker
15. Export to new csv

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
For this project I did not use any external tools.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
In my repository is a folder for each project. The folder for this project contains a notebook, 2 csv's and this readme. The notebook contains all code to process one csv to the other.
