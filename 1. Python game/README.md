## Project Description
I made a game of blackjack because I was looking for a challenge. Blackjack is simple in it's rules but is a little tricky to translate into code.

## Rules
Each player is dealt 2 cards, as well as the dealer. After the first round the player is asked before being dealt a card each time. Goal is to get the highest combination, as long as it's not over 21. If your score is higher than the dealer, you double your bet. If it's lower or you go bust (over 21), you lose the bet. If you have 21 in the first hand (a 'natural') you get 1,5x your bet paid.

## Workflow
I looked up the rules (see below), put it into steps and put those onto a trello board. Then I decided on how to translate those steps into code and worked up from the start of the game to the end. After I put in some nice-to-have's. Because of the small scope I did not create a big overview in text.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
I used a trello board.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
There is one .py file that contains just 400 lines of code. I used a object oriented approach and used classes for the various structures. The main game class has various methods to perform smaller parts of the game.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
