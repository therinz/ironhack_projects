# Ironhack Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my repository containing all the projects I have completed during the Data Analyics Bootcamp at Ironhack. During 9 weeks I will submit 4 individual mini-projects, 2 group projects and one final project. This is what I have completed so far:

## 1. Python game
Individual project to program a game in Python. I choose to make a version of Blackjack, trying to incorporate the official rules and using an object orientated approach. The result is a game that can be played with a varying amount of players, each having an amount of cash and choosing the size of their bet throughout the game. 

## 2. Pandas datacleaning
The second project is also individual, aiming to get more familiar with the various tools that Pandas offers to clean a dataset. Using a very dirty data set regarding shark attacks, the aim is to clean it up as much as possible within the given time. This was done without a specific research question at hand.
